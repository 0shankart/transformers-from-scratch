The simplest option for this function is the dot product:\n",

There is a way to implement multi-head self-attention so that it is roughly as fast as the single-head version, but we still get the benefit of having different self-attention operations in parallel. To accomlish this, each head receives low-dimensinal keys, queries and values.

The benefit is that for a well chosen function, the network should be able to dael with sequences that are longer than those its seen in during training.

We give sequence-to-sequence model a sequence, and we ask it to predict the next character at each point in the sequence. The output of transformer depends on the entire input sequence, so prediction of the next character becomes vacuously easy, just retrieve it from the input. To use self-attention as an autoregressive model, we'll need to ensure that it cann't look forward into the sequence. We do this by applying a mask to the matrix of dot products, before the softmax is applied. This mask disables all elements above the diagonal of the matrix.<br><br>\n",

The encoder takes the input sequence and maps it to a latent representation of the whole sequence. This can be either a sequence of latent vectors, or a single one. This vector is then passed to a decoder which unpacks it to the desired target sequence(for instance, the same sentence in another language).<br><br>\n",
        "*Teacher forcing* refers to the technique of allowing the decoder acces to the input sentence, but in an autoregressive fashion. That is, the decoder generates the output sentence word for word based both on the latent vector and the words it has already generated. This take some of the pressure off the latent representation: the decoder can use word-for-word sampling to take care of the low-level structure like syntax and grammar and use the latent vector to capture more high-level semantic structure. Decoding twice with the same latent represetation would, ideally, give you two different sentences with same meaning.\n"
